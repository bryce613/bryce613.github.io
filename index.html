			<h1>This is Me</h1>
			<p>My name is Brycen Cloward. I'm originally from Kuna, Idaho, and am now residing in Lewiston, Idaho.
			</p>
			<img src = "images/me.jpg" alt = "me">
			<p>I had my first exposure with web design when I was a freshman in high school. Through a program known as PTECH,
			I learned about the basics of web design through dual-credit courses. Learning about and experiencing web design,
			along with support from PTECH, inspired me to learn more. Through the PTECH program, I was able to continue on the
			path to web design, and I was able to get many college credits way before most of my peers got the opportunity to
			do so.</p>
			<p>Now I am attending Lewis-Clark State College to finish my degree in Web Design and Development. I am a freshman,
			but I will have completed an Associate's degree, by the end of the year.</p>
